# Project1


This was our first project and a great dive into how to reverse engineer some code. while keeping tabs on the cooresponding css. Probably made it more complex
for myself, but what I loved what that after redoing it, and re doing it...and re doing it. I started to learn the git flow better, started to get how to place semantics and where tags. ids. class..etc can go.

very cool stuff

Thank you for sharing the code to get us started.

I would also like to thank w3 for showing me how to format a form, that one took a second, but was fun.
